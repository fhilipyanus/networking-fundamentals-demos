This repository is a group of projects/experiments that turn the theoretical knowledge from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)'s module [Network Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals) into practical learning experiences. In every room, there will be a `notes.md` file and a `README.md` file. The `notes.md` file will contain my genuine and unfiltered learning experience as I perform the experiments, while the `README.md` file willl describe and interpret the experiments and projects in a clean and technical way.
