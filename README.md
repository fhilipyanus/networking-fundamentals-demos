This repository is a group of projects/experiments that turn the theoretical knowledge from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)'s module [Network Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals) into practical learning experiences. 

In every room, there will include the following files:
- `notes.md`: my genuine and unfiltered learning experience as I perform the experiments
- `README.md`: describes and interprets the experiments and projects in a clean and technical way.

I donâ€™t just want to read about networking concepts; I want to see them in action. This repo is my way of making abstract ideas (like ICMP or TCP handshakes) tangible through packet captures, scripts, and experiments. This repo is for anyone who is curious about networking and wants simple reproducible demos.
